Section 1 and 2:
Views in SwiftUI has to conform to the View protocol. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view
You can modify views, thanks to the View protocol that provides default implementations, by calling methods, like myView.opacity(0.5).
The order of calling methods matters. The methods do NOT return the same object.
Variables and states in a view are immutable, but can be treated as mutable if the decorator(?) @State is added to the variable.
A bunch of images are available from apple. Can be searched with the app SF Symbols and used with Image(systemName: "name").
